# Patches

We roufly have seen how patches work. Patches can be called as mutations

A Patch describes changes to be made to a target JSON document using a syntax that closely mimics the document being modified. Is like using [Object.assign](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/assign) but for nested object.

The implementation must follow all the rules defined in JSON Merge Patch specification.
